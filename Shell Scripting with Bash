#!/bin/bash  
Make a folder called as "bin" and put your scripts in there 
add the path "PATH="$PATH:~/bin"
Shebang line:- first line of script file starts with #!
separate which interpreter should run the code 
Bash scripts:
#!/bin/bash
other system then linux or mac OS 
May be bash in a different location 
#!user/bin/envbash :- this will find bash on the users path(may not works)
cant give options
results depends on teh isers configuration
How to check does scrpt file name is already used or not by using "type" cmds with file name 

Variables:--
